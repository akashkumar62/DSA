// You are given an array ‘ARR’ consisting of ‘N’ strings. Your task is to find the longest
// common prefix among all these strings. 
//If there is no common prefix, you have to return an empty string.

// A prefix of a string can be defined as a substring obtained after removing some or all 
//characters from the end of the string.

// For Example:
// Consider ARR = [“coding”, ”codezen”, ”codingninja”, ”coders”]
// The longest common prefix among all the given strings is “cod” as it is present as a prefix in all strings. Hence, the answer is “cod”.
